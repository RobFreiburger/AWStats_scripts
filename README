Required modules: XML::Simple, Mail::Sendmail, Data::Dumper, File::Copy 

Each script does a specific task. String them together in a shell script for easy execution.

./bin:
AWStatsConfWriter.pl
Writes the needed configuration file for AWStats. 
Stats are generated per server per host.

AWStatsProcessLogs.pl
Runs AWStats for every host on every server.
Stats are generated per server per host.

apacheConfRetrieval.pl
Pulls virtual host configuration files from Linux servers.
Parses files for necessary information and updates XML file.
Establishes hosts per server.

dataDumper.pl
Debugging purposes only.
Prints out the contents of XML file in understandable format.
Helps with figuring out what data type Perl is expecting.

errorNotification.pl
Puts contents of ./etc/error.log into email message.
Emails errorEmail value set in configuration.xml.
Deletes contents of ./etc/error.log.

hostAWStatsProcessLogs.pl
Deprecated. Use ./bin/hostAWStatsProcessing.pl.
Modification of ./bin/AWStatsProcessLogs.pl.
Processes logs for one host for every server host is on.
Doesn't work as expected; kept for example purposes.

hostAWStatsProcessing.pl
Writes AWStats configuration file per host for every server host is on.
Processes AWStats after writing each configuration file.
Afterward repeats for next server.
Once servers processed, moves on to next host and repeats.

hostServerAssociation.pl
Takes results from ./bin/apacheConfRetrieval.pl and INSERT WINDOWS SCRIPT HERE.
Makes root-level array of hosts then lists server(s) each host is on.
In other words, adds invert of XML file structure to XML file.
Used for per host stats generation.

logRsync.pl
Retrieves log files from Linux servers.

logTail.pl
Captures timestamp of last entry in log file per host per server.
Scripts like ./bin/hostAWStatsProcessing.pl check for timestamp.
If timestamp exists at next run, lots of redundant processing time is saved.

./etc:
configuration.xml
Bare minimum version of XML file. 
Contains everything necessary for scripts to run properly.

template.conf
Template AWStats configuration file.
Automatically generated stats files import settings from this template.
Allows for enabling/disabling features like IP lookup, DNS caching, and browser plug-in reporting.
